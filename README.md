# Socket.io Implementation

## A simple implementation of Socket.IO using Node.js as a POC for a case I'm working on.

- ## Quick Start

  - To install dependencies (packages) run command:

    ```bash
    yan
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

  - To start the socket.io <b>server</b> run command:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

  - To start the socket.io <b>client</b> run command:

    ```bash
    node client.js
    ```

- ## .NET Client

  You may need to connect to your <b>Socket.IO</b> server from a <b>.NET Client</b> which is possible by the way.

  So here is an implementation of the [<b>Socket.IO .NET Client</b>](https://github.com/FawzyMokhtar/Socket.IO-dotnet-Client).
